* cocos2d-x 环境
** 基础工具
1. cocos2d-x-3.17.2 | [[https://www.cocos.com/cocos2dx-download][link]]
   - v4 还在开发中， v3 用户比较多
   - 开发文档 | [[https://docs.cocos.com/cocos2d-x/manual/zh/basic_concepts/][link]]
2. Python2 | 这里不要使用 Python3 会报错
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     # 进入源码目录后
     python setup.py
   #+END_SRC
3. vs2022
   - cocos2d-x 是 vs2015 构建的，这里首次启动时需要迁移一下项目

** 创建项目
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  cocos new HelloGame -p io.github.jeanhwea.hello -l cpp
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (py27) D:\temp\demo> cocos new -p io.github.jeanhwea.hello -l cpp hello
  > 拷贝模板到 D:\temp\demo\hello
  > 拷贝 cocos2d-x ...
  > 替换文件名中的工程名称，'HelloCpp' 替换为 'hello'。
  > 替换文件中的工程名称，'HelloCpp' 替换为 'hello'。
  > 替换工程的包名，'org.cocos2dx.hellocpp' 替换为 'io.github.jeanhwea.hello'。
  > 替换 Mac 工程的 Bundle ID，'org.cocos2dx.hellocpp' 替换为 'io.github.jeanhwea.hello'。
  > 替换 iOS 工程的 Bundle ID，'org.cocos2dx.hellocpp' 替换为 'io.github.jeanhwea.hello'。
  (py27) D:\temp\demo> dir
   驱动器 D 中的卷是 DATA
   卷的序列号是 5645-DEB3

   D:\temp\demo 的目录

  2025/12/01  16:53    <DIR>          .
  2025/12/01  16:15    <DIR>          ..
  2025/12/01  16:53    <DIR>          hello
                 0 个文件              0 字节
                 3 个目录 277,488,177,152 可用字节

  (py27) D:\temp\demo>
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Windows 生成项目
cocos2d-x v3 项目创建报错 GWL_WNDPROC 的解决方法
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  cmake .. -G"Visual Studio 17 2022" -A win32
#+END_SRC

执行日志
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (py27) D:\code\redinf\MyGame\build> cmake .. -G"Visual Studio 17 2022" -A win32
