* what is metallography ?
  Accoring to WikiPedia, Metallography is the study of the physical structure
  and components of metals, typically using microscopy. Ceramic and polymeric
  materials may also be prepared using metallographic techniques, hence the
  terms ceramography, plastography and, collectively, materialography.
